* added update capabilities for all composite shapes
* new higher level plots: ILLitSurface, ILBarGraph3D, ILVectorField
* much improved text rendering for shape labels: ILShapeLabel.FringeColor

* improved lightning for shapes
* added new shapes: ILLitBorderedShape, ILLitQuad, ILLitTriangle
* added new plots: ILLitBox3D, ILBarGraph3D (still under construction)
* possibly breaking change: ILShape.Visible moved to ILSceneGraphNode.Visible
  (as well as some other properties of ILShape)
